const aboutgka='Gujarati Kshatriya Associationwas founded in 1989. The goal of our Non-Profit organization is to unite and serve all our Gujarati Kshatriya communities living in USA-CANADA and to promote and preserve our heritage and language, and bring cultural awareness to future generations by providing a platform to all our community families while serving the community needs.\n\nThe charitable and social activities developed steadily through the past 30+ years and the group cohesiveness of our past and present executive committee members and Board of Trustees along with many volunteers have culminated in a strong and vibrant Gujarati Kshatriya Association. As we continue our progress in 21st century, the foundation of social adaptiveness set forth by our previous executive committee members, has strengthen our resolve and made us proud of our cultural heritage.\n\nWe have very active Mandals like GKA South East Atlanta, Vancouver Mochi Gnati Mandal, GKSNA NY/NJ and Mochi Gnati Mandal of Ontario-Canada where they regularly celebrate Diwali-Mela and picnic during the year. With the help of every Gujarati Kshatriya Association member in our community, we encourage each and every family to participate in cultural and social activities to build our strong youth generation.';
const historygka='In 1989, the concept was initiated to create Mandal by Late Amritbhai P. Champaneri (Gunasvel), Jekishanbhai R. Chauhan, Late Harshadbhai N. Parmar & Dr. Bhandutia from India. The core focus was to organize close contacts and have matrimonial related activities for our community. In 1990,Jekishanbhai Chauhan, withhis own initiative, prepared and published the first community directory. There was  a total of 290 directories which mailed within USA and Canada. The total cost of the directory was sponsored by Late Harshabhai N. Parmar.\n\nVolunteers continued their efforts and started reaching out to the community. The listing of families grew from 290 to 1190 families in 1997.Volunteers decided to meet on June 29th, 1997 in Newnan, GA at Jayantibhai Chauhan’s residence. There were only 12 attendees invited. The goal of this meeting was to form our association and expand community activities in order to bring many scattered families together. Matrimonial was a central objective of our community. Everybody was brain-storming about this objective. First, name of our association was decided as "Gujarati Kshatriya Association (GKA)".  Second, the decision was made to publish another directory. Everyone started working on this project and the pledges were received from all attending volunteers to fund this project. Third, Late Lallubhai Umeria offered to host the first community convention in Las Vegas. Since then we have done several conventions.';
